------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Note -

This is the *experimental* branch and currently under development.

The code is not currently finished, so don't expect it to work. The
interface is incomplete, inconsistent, and hasn't been thought out
enough just yet, but it should be finalized in the near future.

Here's the direction I'm taking it in:

    I'm abstracting the code to use an interface for modelling a DNS
    zone which has methods for creating and manipulating host records.

    Multiple concrete classes can implement the interface, allowing
    for pluggable support of other DNS hosting services such as
    NameCheap or local BIND zone files.

All necessary documentation sould be included in the script.

More details may be included in here in the future. Until then,
