- Note -

This is the *experimental* branch and currently under development.

The code is not currently finished, so don't expect it to work. The
interface is incomplete, inconsistent, and hasn't been thought out
enough just yet, but it should be finalized in the near future.

Here's the direction I'm taking it in:

    I'm abstracting the code to use an interface for modelling a DNS
    zone which has methods for creating and manipulating host records.

    Multiple concrete classes can implement the interface, allowing
    for pluggable support of other DNS hosting services such as
    NameCheap or local BIND zone files.

Known Issue - HTTP Authorization:

If you are getting 401 Uunauthorized or noauth errors and you're
sure the username, password, and hostname are correct, your
web server's configuration may be to blame.

The HTTP authentication used by this script may not work on web
hosts that use FastCGI to serve PHP scripts (e.g. GoDaddy and
Dreamhost). The fix is to add the following to a file named
".htaccess" in the same directory as this script (create the
file if it doesn't exist already):

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
     RewriteEngine on
     RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization},L]
</IfModule>

DD-WRT Configuration:

To use this script with a DD-WRT based router, setup the fields
with the following values:

    DYNDNS Server:  yourdomain.com
    User Name:      Your GoDaddy Username or Member ID
    Password:       Your GoDaddy Password
    Host Name:      yourdomain.com
       or
    Host Name:      subdomain.yourdomain.com
    URL:            /ddns.php?hostname=

The additional DDNS options field can be kept blank and the
force update interval can be set to whatever you wish (it
shouldn't need to be very frequent, 14 days is a good
starting value).

Note: Don't add anything after the hostname= in the URL as DD-WRT
      will automatically append the value of the host name field.

All other documentation sould be included in the script.
